# What is NPM?
-> **npm** stands for Node Package Manager. It's a tool that helps you manage and organize the code libraries (called "packages") your project relies on, written in JavaScript.

Think of npm like a librarian for your project's code. Just as a librarian helps you find and organize books on a shelf, npm helps you find, install, and keep track of the code libraries your project needs.

Here's how it works:

1. **Packages**: npm has a massive online repository of open-source JavaScript packages, created by developers and maintained by the community. These packages are like pre-built Lego blocks that you can use in your project.
2. **Package.json**: In your project's root directory, you create a file called `package.json`. This file lists all the packages your project depends on, along with their versions. It's like a shopping list for your project's code libraries.
3. **npm install**: When you run `npm install`, npm checks your `package.json` file and downloads the required packages from the online repository. It then installs them locally in your project's directory, so you can use them.
4. **Dependency management**: npm keeps track of the versions of each package your project relies on. This ensures that if a package updates, your project won't break. You can also specify specific versions of packages to use, if needed.
5. **Scripts**: In your `package.json` file, you can define custom scripts to run specific commands or tools for your project. This makes it easy to automate tasks, like testing or building your project.

In summary, npm is a package manager that helps you:

* Find and install JavaScript packages (code libraries) for your project
* Organize and keep track of these packages in your `package.json` file
* Manage dependencies and versions to ensure your project runs smoothly
* Automate tasks with custom scripts

By using npm, you can focus on writing your project's code, while npm takes care of the behind-the-scenes package management.

# What Is package.json & package-lock.json ?

`package.json` and `package-lock.json` are essential files in Node.js projects, particularly when using npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies.

## package.json

- **Purpose**: 
  - Serves as the manifest for your Node.js project, containing metadata and managing dependencies.

- **Key Components**:
  - **name**: The name of your project.
  - **version**: The current version of your project.
  - **description**: A brief description of what your project does.
  - **main**: The entry point of your application (usually `index.js`).
  - **scripts**: Scripts that can be run using npm (e.g., testing, building).
  - **dependencies**: Lists the packages your project needs to run.
  - **devDependencies**: Lists packages needed only for development (e.g., testing frameworks).

- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A simple example app",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.17.1"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "jest": "^26.6.0"
    }
  }


## Understanding `scripts`, `dependencies`, and versioning symbols (`^`, `~`)

### What are `scripts` in `package.json`?

The `scripts` section in the `package.json` file allows you to define custom commands that can be run using the Node Package Manager (npm). These commands are useful for automating tasks like starting the application, running tests, or building the project.

#### Example of `scripts`:
````
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "mocha tests/*.js",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
````
- **start**: Runs the application (e.g., `node index.js`).
- **test**: Executes test cases using a test framework like Mocha.
- **build**: Runs the build process using Webpack.
- **lint**: Runs ESLint to check code quality.

#### Running Scripts :
You can run these scripts from the terminal using
npm:
````bash
npm start
npm run test
npm run build
npm run lint
````

Note: For the `start` script, you donâ€™t need to include the `run` keyword

---
### What are `dependencies` in `package.json`?

Dependencies in `package.json` define the external libraries or packages that your project requires to run. When someone installs your project with `npm install`, these dependencies will also be installed.

#### Example of `dependencies`:
````json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "lodash": "~4.17.20"
  }
}
````

- **express**: A popular web framework for Node.js.
- **lodash**: A utility library providing helpful functions for common programming tasks.

#### Development Dependencies
In addition to regular dependencies, you can specify development-only dependencies using the `devDependencies` section. These are packages that are only needed during development, such as linters or testing frameworks.

````json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.32.0",
    "mocha": "~8.4.0"
  }
}
````

You can install dependencies with:
````bash
npm install
````

You can install development dependencies with:
````bash
npm install --save-dev <package-name>
````

---

### What do `^` and `~` mean in version numbers?

In `package.json`, dependencies are often defined with version ranges. The symbols `^` and `~` are used to specify the versioning flexibility for these dependencies:

#### The `^` Symbol (Caret)
The caret (`^`) allows updating to newer versions, but only within the same **major version**. For example:

- `"express": "^4.17.1"`

This means:
- The version must be **at least** `4.17.1`.
- The version can be updated to anything below the next **major** version, which would be `5.0.0`.
- Valid updates: `4.18.0`, `4.19.2`, etc., but **not** `5.0.0`.

**Why `^`?**  
It allows you to automatically get patches and minor updates, which should be backward-compatible according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

#### The `~` Symbol (Tilde)
The tilde (`~`) allows updating to newer versions, but only within the same **minor version**. For example:

- `"lodash": "~4.17.20"`

This means:
- The version must be **at least** `4.17.20`.
- The version can be updated to anything below the next **minor** version, which would be `4.18.0`.
- Valid updates: `4.17.21`, `4.17.22`, etc., but **not** `4.18.0` or `5.0.0`.

**Why `~`?**  
It allows only patch updates, which are usually bug fixes, and avoids potentially breaking changes that could come with minor updates.

#### Example Scenarios:
- If your dependency is `"express": "^4.17.1"`, the project can install `4.17.2`, `4.18.0`, or `4.19.3`, but **not** `5.0.0`.
- If your dependency is `"lodash": "~4.17.20"`, the project can install `4.17.21` or `4.17.22`, but **not** `4.18.0`.

---

### Summary of `^` vs. `~`

| Symbol | Meaning  | Example  | Updates Allowed  |
|--------|----------|----------|------------------|
| `^`    | Caret    | `^4.17.1`| `4.18.0`, `4.19.x`, but **not** `5.x.x` |
| `~`    | Tilde    | `~4.17.1`| `4.17.x`, but **not** `4.18.0` or `5.x.x` |

- Use `^` when you want more flexibility and are confident about backward compatibility within a major version.
- Use `~` when you want more stability and prefer to only receive patch updates.

---

### Best Practices
- For libraries that are actively maintained and have strong versioning practices, use `^` to keep your dependencies up-to-date with minor and patch releases.
- For critical projects where even minor updates may cause issues, use `~` to limit updates to just patches.
- Always keep an eye on your `package-lock.json` to ensure consistency across different environments.

## What is Browserlist ?
**Browserslist** is a tool used in front-end development to specify which browsers and versions a project should support. It helps developers ensure that their web applications are compatible with a defined set of browsers, making it easier to manage and maintain cross-browser compatibility. Browserslist can be integrated with various front-end tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, ESLint, and many others to automatically adjust the code and styling based on the specified browsers.

### Key Features of Browserslist:

1. **Easy Configuration**:
   - Browserslist allows you to define browser support using a simple configuration file, which can be placed in various formats (e.g., `.browserslistrc`, `package.json`, or as a configuration in build tools).
   - Example configuration in a `.browserslistrc` file:
     ```
     > 0.5%
     last 2 versions
     not dead
     ```

2. **Queries**:
   - Browserslist uses a query syntax similar to CSS media queries to specify which browsers to include or exclude. Some common queries include:
     - `> 0.5%`: Browsers with more than 0.5% market share.
     - `last 2 versions`: The last two versions of each browser.
     - `not dead`: Excludes browsers that are no longer maintained (no updates in the last 24 months).
     - `chrome >= 60`: Chrome version 60 and above.
     - `firefox < 80`: Firefox versions below 80.

3. **Integration with Build Tools**:
   - Browserslist is widely supported by various tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, ESLint, and PostCSS. This integration helps automatically apply necessary polyfills, transpile JavaScript, and add vendor prefixes based on the specified browser support.

4. **Automatically Updates**:
   - Browserslist can automatically update the list of supported browsers based on real-world usage statistics, which can help you keep up with the latest trends in browser usage.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - By targeting a specific set of browsers, you can optimize your code for performance, reducing the size of the bundles and improving loading times.

6. **Usage Statistics**:
   - Browserslist uses data from services like [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) and [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/) to determine browser market share and support. This helps you make informed decisions about which browsers to support.

### Example Usage:

To use Browserslist, follow these steps:

1. **Install Browserslist**:
   If you're using a package manager like npm or Yarn, you can install it in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install browserslist --save-dev
   ```

2. **Create a Configuration File**:
   Create a `.browserslistrc` file in your project root with your desired browser support. For example:
   ```
   > 0.5%
   last 2 versions
   not dead
   ```

3. **Integrate with Tools**:
   Use Browserslist with other tools in your build process. For example, if you're using Babel, it will read the configuration and transpile your code accordingly. If you're using Autoprefixer, it will add the appropriate vendor prefixes based on the specified browsers.

### Example Configuration in `package.json`:

You can also define your Browserslist configuration directly in your `package.json` file:

````json
{
  "browserslist": [
    "> 0.5%",
    "last 2 versions",
    "not dead"
  ]
}
````

### Summary

**Browserslist** is a powerful tool that helps developers specify and manage browser support for their web applications. By using simple queries in configuration files, you can ensure that your project is compatible with the desired set of browsers, leading to better cross-browser compatibility, optimized code, and an overall improved user experience. Its integration with popular front-end tools makes it a valuable addition to any web development project.

## What is `package-lock.json`?

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated when you run `npm install` in a Node.js project. It is used to **lock** the versions of dependencies (and their sub-dependencies) to ensure that the project runs the same way on all environments (e.g., your computer, a teammateâ€™s computer, or a server). 

The primary purpose of `package-lock.json` is to:
- **Lock down the exact versions** of the dependencies installed.
- Ensure **consistent installs** across different systems.
- Provide **faster installs** since it skips version resolution and uses the locked versions directly.

Even though it is auto-generated, **it should be committed to version control** (e.g., GitHub) to ensure everyone who works on the project has the same dependency versions.

---

## What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

Both files are related to managing dependencies in a Node.js project, but they serve different purposes.

### 1. **Purpose**:

- **`package.json`**:
  - This file is used to define the **metadata** of the project (name, version, description, author, etc.).
  - It lists the **dependencies** and **version ranges** for each package required by your project.
  - Also contains useful project **scripts** (such as `start`, `test`, `build`).

- **`package-lock.json`**:
  - This file **locks the exact versions** of the dependencies and their sub-dependencies at the time they are installed.
  - Ensures that when someone else installs the project, they get the **exact same versions** of the packages, even if new versions of those packages have been released.

### 2. **Versioning**:

- **`package.json`**: 
  - Contains **version ranges** (e.g., `^1.0.0` or `~1.0.0`) that specify the minimum or compatible versions of packages, but not necessarily the exact version.
  - Example:
    ```json
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.17.1"
    }
    ```

- **`package-lock.json`**:
  - Contains **exact versions** of all dependencies (and their sub-dependencies) that were installed.
  - Example:
    ```json
    "express": {
      "version": "4.17.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-xyz123..."
    }
    ```

### 3. **Behavior during installation**:

- **`package.json`**:
  - Defines the main **range of versions** that are acceptable for each package. When you run `npm install`, npm fetches the **latest compatible version** within the specified range.
  
- **`package-lock.json`**:
  - When `package-lock.json` exists, npm uses the **exact versions** specified in it during installation, ensuring the same versions are used across different systems or installations.

### 4. **Updating Dependencies**:

- **`package.json`**:
  - When you update a dependency or add a new one, it changes the **version range** in `package.json`.

- **`package-lock.json`**:
  - Whenever you install or update packages, the `package-lock.json` is updated with the **new exact versions** of the dependencies that were installed.

---

## Summary of Differences:

| Aspect                          | `package.json`                            | `package-lock.json`                         |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                      | Defines project metadata, dependencies, and version ranges. | Locks the exact versions of all installed dependencies. |
| **Versioning**                   | Specifies version **ranges** (e.g., `^1.0.0`). | Specifies the **exact version** of installed packages (e.g., `1.0.0`). |
| **Use**                          | Lists dependencies and scripts for the project. | Ensures consistent installations across systems by locking versions. |
| **Updates**                      | Manually updated when dependencies are added or modified. | Auto-updated when you run `npm install` or update dependencies. |
| **Installation**                 | Installs the **latest compatible versions** within the version range. | Installs the **exact versions** as defined in `package-lock.json`. |

---

In short, while `package.json` defines what packages your project needs and in what version range, `package-lock.json` ensures that every time the project is installed, the **same exact versions** of those packages are used, ensuring consistency across different environments.

---


## What is `node_modules`?

The `node_modules` folder is where all the external packages (dependencies) required by your Node.js project are installed and stored. When you run the command `npm install`, Node Package Manager (npm) fetches the necessary packages from the npm registry and saves them in the `node_modules` directory.

### Key Points:
- It contains all the libraries (dependencies) your project needs, as listed in the `package.json` file.
- It may also include **sub-dependencies**, which are the dependencies of the libraries you installed.
- Each package in `node_modules` has its own folder, and it may have its own `node_modules` folder if it depends on other packages.

### Example:
If your `package.json` includes the following:
````json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.17.1",
  "lodash": "^4.17.20"
}
````

After running `npm install`, the `node_modules` folder will contain:
````bash
node_modules/
  express/
  lodash/
  (and possibly other sub-dependencies)
````

---

### What is inside `node_modules`?

The `node_modules` folder includes:
1. **Code for the packages**: This is the actual code of the libraries you are using, like `express` or `lodash`.
2. **Sub-dependencies**: Packages needed by your dependencies (e.g., `express` may rely on other libraries, which will also be installed).
3. **Metadata and config files**: Each package has its own `package.json` file inside `node_modules`, which includes its version, dependencies, scripts, etc.

---

### Why is `node_modules` important?

- **Project functionality**: Without the `node_modules` folder, your project wonâ€™t have access to the libraries it depends on, and it wonâ€™t run properly.
- **Local environment**: Each project has its own `node_modules` folder, meaning different projects can use different versions of the same library without conflicts.

---

### Should `node_modules` be included in version control (e.g., Git)?

No, you typically **do not commit** the `node_modules` folder to version control (e.g., GitHub). Instead, you commit the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. Any user who clones your project can run `npm install`, and npm will recreate the `node_modules` folder based on the information in `package-lock.json`.

To prevent it from being committed, you add it to the `.gitignore` file like this:
````
./node_modules/
````

---

### Summary

- The `node_modules` folder stores all the packages (and sub-packages) that your Node.js project depends on.
- It is automatically created when you run `npm install`.
- It should **not be committed** to version control; instead, you commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- If deleted, it can be easily recreated by running `npm install` again.

In short, `node_modules` is the "storage" for all the external code your project needs to function.

---
## What is Bundler ?
A **bundler** is a tool that takes multiple files and dependencies in your project (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and bundles them into fewer files, often just one or a few, for efficient loading in the browser. This is especially important in web development, where reducing the number of requests to the server and optimizing file sizes can greatly improve performance.

### Why do we need bundlers?

In modern web development, projects often consist of multiple modules and files:
- JavaScript libraries and frameworks
- CSS stylesheets
- HTML files
- Images and assets

Managing all of these files separately can lead to a slower website due to multiple HTTP requests and larger files. Bundlers help by:
1. **Combining files**: They merge many small files into one or a few larger files to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
2. **Minifying files**: They remove unnecessary characters (like spaces, comments) from code to reduce file size.
3. **Dependency management**: Bundlers handle all the dependencies between modules and make sure they are loaded in the correct order.

---

### Popular Bundlers:

1. **Webpack**:
   - One of the most popular bundlers for JavaScript applications.
   - Can handle not only JavaScript but also CSS, images, and other assets.
   - Offers powerful features like **code splitting** (loading parts of your code only when needed), **hot module replacement** (updating parts of your app without reloading the entire page), and more.

2. **Parcel**:
   - A simpler bundler that requires little configuration.
   - Great for beginners or smaller projects because it has sensible defaults and supports many file types out of the box (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc.).

3. **Rollup**:
   - A bundler designed for libraries and smaller JavaScript projects.
   - It produces smaller and more optimized bundles compared to other tools.
   - Often used to bundle JavaScript libraries for distribution.

4. **Vite**:
   - A modern bundler designed for development with frameworks like **Vue.js** and **React**.
   - It focuses on fast performance and uses **ES modules** (native in modern browsers) for quicker builds and instant hot module replacement.

---

### How Bundlers Work:

1. **Entry Point**:
   - The bundler starts with an "entry point," which is typically your main JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`). This file imports or depends on other modules or assets.

2. **Dependency Graph**:
   - The bundler analyzes your code and builds a **dependency graph**. This graph maps out how all your files (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) are connected and dependent on each other.

3. **Bundling**:
   - The bundler then combines all the dependent files into one or more "bundles." These bundles include all the necessary code and assets for your application to run properly in the browser.

4. **Optimization**:
   - As part of the bundling process, the tool can also **minify** the files (removing unnecessary characters), **tree-shake** (remove unused code), and perform other optimizations to reduce the final file size.

---

### Benefits of Using Bundlers:

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Fewer files to load means fewer HTTP requests, which leads to faster page load times.
   - Minified and optimized code reduces file sizes, helping the page load faster.

2. **Better Dependency Management**:
   - Bundlers automatically handle dependencies between different files and modules, ensuring everything loads in the right order.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - Bundlers often transpile (convert) newer JavaScript code (like ES6+) into versions that work across all browsers, ensuring compatibility.

4. **Asset Handling**:
   - Modern bundlers can handle not just JavaScript, but also CSS, images, and other static assets, allowing you to treat them like modules.

---

### Example:

Hereâ€™s how a bundler like Webpack would work in a project:

1. You have an `index.js` file that imports several modules:
   ```javascript
   import add from './math.js';
   import './styles.css';
   
   console.log(add(2, 3));
   ```

2. The bundler (e.g., Webpack) starts at `index.js`, finds all the imports (`math.js` and `styles.css`), and combines them into a single file called `bundle.js`.

3. During this process, it also minifies the JavaScript and CSS files to reduce the size of the final bundle.

4. You include the generated `bundle.js` in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="bundle.js"></script>
   ```

Now, when your browser loads the page, it only needs to load one JavaScript file, `bundle.js`, which contains all the JavaScript and CSS your app needs.

---

### Summary

A **bundler** is a tool that combines, optimizes, and manages the assets of a web project (like JavaScript, CSS, and images) into fewer, more efficient files. It ensures faster load times, handles dependencies between modules, and can perform optimizations like minification and code splitting. Popular bundlers include **Webpack**, **Parcel**, and **Rollup**, and they are essential for modern web development.

---
## What is Parcel ?
**Parcel** is a modern, fast, and easy-to-use **bundler** for web development projects. It helps developers bundle their JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and other assets into optimized files for production. One of the key advantages of Parcel is that it requires **minimal configuration** compared to other bundlers like Webpack, making it a great choice for beginners and small to medium projects.

Here are some additional **features of Parcel** that make it a powerful and developer-friendly bundler:
### Key Features of Parcel:
#### 1. **Zero Configuration**
Parcelâ€™s standout feature is that it works without any complex configuration files. You can start using it in your project immediately without worrying about setting up complicated build tools. It detects the files in your project and automatically knows how to handle them.

#### 2. **Multi-Core Processing**
Parcel uses all of your computer's CPU cores to process files in parallel, which speeds up the bundling process. This is one of the reasons why Parcel is so fast compared to other bundlers.

#### 3. **Built-in Development Server**
Parcel comes with a built-in development server that serves your files during development. It automatically refreshes the page in your browser when you make changes, and with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**, you donâ€™t even need to reload the pageâ€”changes are reflected instantly without losing the state of your app.

#### 4. **Out-of-the-Box TypeScript Support**
Parcel has native support for **TypeScript** without needing extra configuration. You can simply install Parcel and start writing TypeScript files, and it will automatically transpile them to JavaScript during the build process.

#### 5. **Support for Many Asset Types**
Parcel can handle more than just JavaScript. It supports a wide range of file types including:
- **CSS**, **SASS**, **LESS**: For styling.
- **HTML**: Handles the HTML entry points.
- **Images**: Parcel can optimize images and other static assets like SVG, PNG, and JPG files.
- **Fonts**: Manages and optimizes font files.
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Supports modern WebAssembly for high-performance web apps.

#### 6. **Automatic Code Splitting**
Parcel automatically splits your code into smaller, lazy-loaded chunks based on the dynamic imports in your code. This means that only the necessary parts of your application are loaded at runtime, improving performance by reducing the size of the initial download.

#### 7. **Tree Shaking**
Parcel automatically removes unused code from your project (known as **tree shaking**). This ensures that your final production bundle only includes the parts of the code that are actually used, reducing the bundle size.

#### 8. **Source Maps**
During development, Parcel generates **source maps** for JavaScript and CSS files. Source maps help you debug your minified code by mapping the transformed code back to the original source files, so you can see where errors occur in your original code.

#### 9. **Environment Support**
Parcel automatically detects whether youâ€™re building for **development** or **production**:
- **Development Mode**: Fast builds with source maps and hot module replacement.
- **Production Mode**: Minified files, tree shaking, and optimizations for faster performance and smaller file sizes.

#### 10. **Plugin Ecosystem**
While Parcel works out of the box with many types of files, it also has a **plugin system** that allows you to extend its functionality. You can install community plugins to support additional languages or features that arenâ€™t natively supported.

#### 11. **CSS & JS Processing**
Parcel automatically handles **CSS imports** and **CSS modules**, and it supports **PostCSS** for transforming your CSS files. It also processes JavaScript files, applying optimizations like minification and transpiling ES6+ syntax into browser-compatible versions.

#### 12. **Automatic Dependency Management**
Parcel automatically resolves dependencies for files you import (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.). If your project relies on third-party libraries, Parcel ensures that all necessary dependencies are bundled, handled, and optimized in the final output.

#### 13. **Minification**
For production builds, Parcel minifies your JavaScript, CSS, and other assets to reduce their size. This helps to improve load times and overall performance of your application when deployed.

#### 14. **Caching for Faster Builds**
Parcel caches previously processed files, meaning that after the initial build, any subsequent builds are much faster since only changed files are processed.

#### 15. **HTTPS Support**
Parcel provides an option to run the development server with **HTTPS** for secure local testing. This can be important when working with features like service workers or when testing apps that require secure connections.

#### 16. **Support for Web Workers**
Parcel can bundle **Web Workers** into your project. Web Workers allow you to run JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main thread, which can improve the performance of your web app, especially for heavy computations.

#### 17. **Optimized for Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**
Parcel automatically transpiles modern JavaScript syntax to make it compatible with older browsers. You donâ€™t need to manually set up Babel or any other tools to achieve this; Parcel does it for you out of the box.

### How Parcel Works:

1. **Entry Point**:
   - Parcel starts by looking at your main file, such as `index.html` or `index.js`, and then analyzes all the files it depends on (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).

2. **Bundling**:
   - Parcel bundles all the files together, optimizing them by reducing file sizes, minifying the code, and combining modules.

3. **Development**:
   - During development, Parcel runs a local server and provides Hot Module Replacement, so you can see changes in real-time.

4. **Production**:
   - For production builds, Parcel automatically optimizes your code, handles tree shaking, and generates a smaller, optimized output ready for deployment.

2. **Set Up Your Project**:
   Suppose you have a simple project with an `index.html` and a `main.js` file:

   - `index.html`:
     ````html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Parcel Example</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, Parcel!</h1>
       <script src="main.js"></script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ````

   - `main.js`:
     ````javascript
     console.log('Parcel is working!');
     ````

3. **Run Parcel**:
   To bundle and serve the project, simply run:
   ````bash
   parcel index.html
   ````

4. **Parcel Development Server**:
   This command will start a development server with Hot Module Replacement, allowing you to see the output in your browser and instantly see changes.

5. **Building for Production**:
   When you're ready to build for production, run:
   ````bash
   parcel build index.html
   ````
   This command will generate optimized files for deployment, including minified JavaScript and CSS.

## Differences Of NPM AND NPX ?
**npx** and **npm** are both tools associated with Node.js, but they serve different purposes. Understanding how they differ can help you manage packages and run commands more effectively in your projects.

### What is **npm**?

**npm** (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It helps developers manage and install JavaScript libraries or tools (called packages or modules). With npm, you can:
- **Install packages** globally or locally.
- **Manage dependencies** for your project by creating a `package.json` file.
- **Run scripts** defined in the `package.json` file using `npm run`.

### Common npm commands:
- **npm install** (or `npm i`): Installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- **npm install [package-name]**: Installs a package locally (to `node_modules`).
- **npm install -g [package-name]**: Installs a package globally so it can be used from anywhere on your machine.
- **npm run [script-name]**: Runs a custom script defined in `package.json`.

### What is **npx**?

**npx** is a tool bundled with **npm** (starting from npm version 5.2 and above) that allows you to run Node.js commands directly from your terminal without needing to install the package globally. It makes running one-time or local executables easier by handling the installation and execution for you.

### Differences between **npx** and **npm**:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **npm**: Primarily used for managing, installing, and uninstalling packages (globally or locally) and running scripts defined in `package.json`.
   - **npx**: Used for running **executables** from local or remote packages without installing them globally.

2. **Temporary Installation**:
   - **npx**: Can temporarily download and run a package. After the command finishes, it cleans up the downloaded package. This is useful for running packages or commands that you donâ€™t want to install permanently (e.g., `npx create-react-app`).
   - **npm**: Requires you to **install** the package first, either locally or globally, before you can use it. For example, if you want to use `create-react-app` without `npx`, you would need to install it globally using `npm install -g create-react-app`.

3. **Global Installation**:
   - **npm**: When you install a package globally using npm (`npm install -g`), it becomes available system-wide, and you can run it from anywhere in your terminal.
   - **npx**: Allows you to run the command without a global installation. For example, running `npx create-react-app my-app` creates a new React app without having to install `create-react-app` globally.

4. **Executing Local Scripts**:
   - **npm**: If you want to execute a script installed in your project locally (e.g., inside `node_modules`), you often need to reference it with `npm run`, or directly from `node_modules/.bin/`.
   - **npx**: Can run the local version of a package without specifying the path. For example, `npx mocha` runs the locally installed version of the `mocha` testing framework in your project without needing to prefix the command with `./node_modules/.bin/`.

5. **One-Time Use**:
   - **npx**: Ideal for **one-time use** of packages. For example, if you need to quickly check something with a CLI tool, you can run it with `npx` instead of installing the tool globally.
   - **npm**: Requires you to install the tool/package globally for repeated use.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Using npm**:
  1. To use a tool like `create-react-app`, you'd first install it globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g create-react-app
     ```
  2. Then you could run it like this:
     ```bash
     create-react-app my-app
     ```

- **Using npx**:
  1. With npx, you can skip the global installation and run it directly:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-app
     ```
  2. This runs the command without permanently installing `create-react-app` globally.

### Advantages of npx:
- **Avoid Global Installs**: You can avoid cluttering your global environment with packages you only need once or occasionally.
- **Always Uses Latest Version**: When using `npx`, it ensures you're using the latest version of the package or tool.
- **Runs Local Packages**: It can run locally installed packages, even if they are not globally available.

### Summary of Key Differences:

| Feature          | **npm**                                      | **npx**                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Role**  | Package manager                              | Executes packages without global installation |
| **Installation**  | Installs packages globally or locally        | Runs packages without installing them globally|
| **Usage**         | Requires installation before use             | No need to install globally to run a package  |
| **Global Clutter**| Can lead to global package clutter           | Avoids global installations for one-time use  |
| **Running Locally Installed Packages** | Requires path or `npm run`  | Can run directly with `npx`                  |

In summary, **npm** is great for managing dependencies and installing packages, while **npx** shines when you need to run packages or commands without the overhead of global installation, making it especially useful for tools or commands that are used only occasionally.
